- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Docker & Kubernetes on Udemy. Trying to broaden my horizons and become "full stack" if that's even possible
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-hutchinson-dev/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been playing guitar for over 10 years, my dad showing my rock music on youtube ğŸ“º started me down a huge rabbit hole ğŸ¤˜
